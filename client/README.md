# SplitStack client

Static front end of SplitStack. **Review 1 (HTML + CSS)**: every screen is a plain HTML page with sample data,
styled by a layered CSS design system. No JavaScript is used yet.

## View it

```bash
npm run client
```

Then open http://localhost:5500. Opening `index.html` directly from disk also works.

## Structure

```
index.html            landing page
pages/                24 app pages (dashboard, expenses, groups, settlements, shopping, OCR, ...)
css/main.css          entry point: imports the layers below in order
css/tokens.css        colours, type, spacing; dark default + light theme
css/base.css          reset, typography, focus ring, skip link
css/layout.css        app shell, sidebar, topbar, grids, responsive breakpoints
css/components.css    cards, buttons, forms, tables, meters, charts, ...
css/pages.css         page-specific pieces (hero, dashboard, receipt view)
css/utilities.css     small helpers
assets/               favicon and the sample receipt image
```

## CSS techniques worth pointing out

| Technique | Where |
|---|---|
| Cascade layers (`@layer`) to control override order | `main.css` |
| Custom properties as design tokens; light theme via `prefers-color-scheme` and `[data-theme]` | `tokens.css` |
| Mobile drawer with no JS: hidden checkbox + `:has()` | `layout.css` |
| Equal/custom split toggle with no JS: `form:has(#split-custom:checked)` | `pages.css` |
| Purchased shopping items struck through: `.check-item:has(input:checked)` | `components.css` |
| Doughnut chart from `conic-gradient`, bar chart from flexbox + `--h` | `components.css` |
| Tables become labelled cards on phones via `td::before { content: attr(data-label) }` | `components.css` |
| Validation feedback only after interaction: `:user-invalid` | `components.css` |
| `color-mix()` for tinted category tags from one `--cat` colour | `components.css` |
| Fluid type with `clamp()`, `prefers-reduced-motion` support | `tokens.css` |

## Checks

```bash
npx html-validate "client/**/*.html"
```

All pages validate with zero errors (config in `.htmlvalidate.json`). Text colours meet WCAG AA contrast.
